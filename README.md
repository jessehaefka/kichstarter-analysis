### Purpose

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- When sorting the data by launch date the greatest amount of successful outcomes seems to occur during the summer months. However the amount of failed outcomes 
	is also at the highest outcome during the summer months. Cancelled outcomes do not seem to correlate to a launch date. 

- When resorting the data by Goal amount, the higher the goal is the more likely the outcome will be a failure. 

- When sorting the outcome by goal amount there is a jump in success rate between 35000 and 40000. However this is not likely to be statistically significant 
	since there are less than 10 data points for this category.   

- line graphs work the best for data over time. if the data was time independent a bar graph would be fine.
